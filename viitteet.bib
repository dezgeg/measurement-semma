% Dr. Barry Feigenbau, an IBM employee, invented the core of the original SMB protocol, which he initially named after himself: "BAF". He later changed the name to be "SMB" (for "Server Message Block")
% IBM, Microsoft, 3Com and Intel made up the rest of the initial protocol together.
% The commands the protocol supported at this stage were basically a mirror of the DOS File IO API calls,

% The filesharing protocol at the heart of CIFS is an updated version of the venerable Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which dates back to the mid-1980s.
% The new name first appeared around 1996/97 when Microsoft submitted draft CIFS specifications to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
% Microsoft's implementations are the de facto CIFS standards. This is no surprise, as the SMB protocol was originally developed by IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and 3Com specifically for MS-DOS and PC-DOS.
% Like NetBIOS, the Server Message Block protocol originated a long time ago at IBM. Microsoft embraced it, extended it, and in 1996 gave it a marketing upgrade by renaming it "CIFS."
% In 1992, X/Open (now known as The Open Group) published an SMB specification titled Protocols for X/Open PC Interworking: SMB, Version 2.
