\begin{abstract}
Network file systems allow users to access and work on their files over the network,
just as if they were local files.
They are used in universities and large corporations for example,
with simplified backups and being able to use shared workstations as some benefits for them.
In this paper we will examine two popular network file system protocols, NFS and SMB/CIFS.
We will take a look their capabilities and history,
followed by some approaches of measuring the protocols or their implementations.
As good performance has been an important design goal of the protocols,
performance measurements of network file system protocols are well studied.
Specifically, we will investigate Postmark, a generic file system benchmark,
LADDIS, a NFS protocol level benchmark and TODO something else.
Then we will look into measuring performance improvements of NFS protocol version 4.1.
% TODO: the NetApp stuff here as well
